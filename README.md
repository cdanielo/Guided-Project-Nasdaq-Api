# Exploring Financial Data Using Nasdaq Data Link API

The project involves interacting with the Nasdaq Data Link API, specifically the MER/F1 data table, to retrieve detailed financial information (such as balance sheets, cash flow statements, and income statements) for a specified set of companies. The emphasis will be on analyzing metrics like Accrued Expenses Turnover to understand financial performance over time.

The primary goal of the project is to conduct a detailed analysis of this financial data, which includes:

* Trend analysis to understand the evolution of financial performance.

* Comparative studies to examine differences among companies and regions.

* Creation of effective visualizations to present the findings.
